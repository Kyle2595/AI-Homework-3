The code will output the best move for the current state.  

As per the instructions, if you were to play Nim and input the number of sticks
as 3, the program will tell you to remove 2 sticks, leaving your opponent with 
the last stick to pick up.  Therefore you win.

Tic Tac Toe still has some errors, it makes moves even after a player wins.
It will iterate through all the possible solutions correctly in MinmaxSearch,
but it will print the final state, not just the next state.

A general strategy for Nim is that player 2 can only win if n mod 4 = 1;
So as player 1, you want to make sure you never let the number of sticks mod 4
equal to 1.

For Nim' when the player who picks the last stick wins, you want to make sure
the total number of sticks n mod 4 = 0 if you want to win.
